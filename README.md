## Figuring Out

Very confused with this workflow, OSX is like a one trick pony!

1. Still unsure how to sort with this awful launcher bar that wont go on multiple screens. Hard to discern what is open or not, the top bar is useless unless in full screen.
2. Alt Tab is uncustomisable and its terrible to use one one screen and no previews, and apps are there that were closed.
3. Apps dont actually close they hang around and the bar gets wide, so does alt tab, have to make custom key to Cmd+Q them and map Alt+F4 so it acts normal.
4. Focusing Apps is very illogical and sometimes windows vanish., have to make custom key to Cmd+Q them and map Alt+F4 so it acts normal.
5. Virtual Desktops (or "Spaces") will make a disaster out of where what windows are.
6. Terminal is a nightmare. Cannot recognize Home/End, Ctrl+a/e, and quite a bit else going on here.
7. Home/End keys dont work at all, cant remap to "command + left" and hope to use as a hotkey in Vscode because the overwriting madness.
8. The App selection is sub-par compared to all things free on linux its crazy.
9. The keyboard is like typing upsidown with my fingers glued. lol.

Man oh man.
